https://www.apachelounge.com/download/VC14/binaries/httpd-2.4.25-win64-VC14.zip

Steps to install

1.	Install Visual Studio C++ Redistributable 2015 – 64 bit (You might already have this)
2.	Extract httpd-2.4.25-win64-VC14.zip in C drive  (C:\Apache24)
Some of you might not have access to C drive. In that case, you can extract anywhere but we have to make few changes in C:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf file
Open httpd.conf file using any text editor and search for all the occurrences of c: and update it with the new path  
3.	<Directory "c:/Apache24/htdocs">   - By default all html files are stored here (Similar to Tomcat Webapp folder). You can override the path to any location.  
4.	Next step is to install Apache service. To do this, open cmd prompt (Run as administrator) and navigate to C:\Apache24\bin and type http.exe -k install
5.	Run ApacheMonitor.exe from the path C:\Apache24\bin\ApacheMonitor.exe (Run as administrator). This will create a new icon in status bar next to data time (Bottom right corner)
6.	Right click the icon and open Apache Monitor. This will open the following screen
 
7.	Click Start to start the server
 
8.	Via browser hit the URL: http://localhost (http://localhost:80) Default port no., is 80 so it is not necessary to add 80.
 
If you were able see the above screen then you have installed the server successfully.
